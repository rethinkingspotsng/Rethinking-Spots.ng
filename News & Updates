18/January/2017 ******* 
Hi guys. I'm creating this file to keep up with latest updates based on our discussions, agreements and activities.
************
I have been chatting back and forth with one member of our group, Ebuka Valentine. he made some suggestions which I agree with.
He suggested that we move discussions and arguments to a private group instead of populating the radar thread with long talks and
discussions for the benefit of those that are only interested the final outcome of the project. So I siggested that we create a
slack/whatsapp group where we can discuss and share resources. The group has not been created as I want to have validations from
other members of this group.
So please let me know what you think.
**********************
Secondly, as Valentine has been the only one that I've been in active communication with, I had a skype session with him some days
ago on our ideas for the project and moving forward and I must say, the man has ideas!
He suggested some nice to haves for the project during the course of our conversation but since we didn't record the session,
I will only list some of the points he raised here. 

1. The system should be social: I.E People should be able to share places and leave reviews of places they've been to and descriptions
of their overall experience of the place. This is so that prospective visitors will have a full understanding of the place their
are planning to go.

2. Curation: We also thought it would be super beneficial to have curators write and curate pictures about experiences and places.
For example, we can have people post high quality articles and videos about the best places to do business, hangout or eat certain
foods in certain neighborhoods.

3. Categorisation and Organization: For better experience and easier navigation, he suggested that we have a category based 
navigation so that a user will be able to easily find places based on the theme of their visit. That is, if you are travelling 
for religious purposes, you should be able to find a category for religious travellers and you wont be lost in the sea of nightlife
listings. Same for someone browsing solely for pleasurable, sporting or cultural experiences etc.

4. And for accomodations, we'll simply list the hotels in the neighborhood you're searching for. Also, we thought we might develop
a new breadandbreakfast/private accommodation system that we'll personally vet and verify before listing them. This is to allow for 
more and less expensive accomodation system for tourists and travellers.

We planned to have chat sessions like every three days or so. Please indicate around what time would be best for you so we can schedule
accordingly.
For the next chat session, we'll decide the final directions we want to go and start designing the experience and architecture.
